# Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a web-based task and scheduling application for Mr. K, a project coordinator at TechCo in South Korea. Mr. K manages 5-6 concurrent projects across multiple departments, coordinating tasks with development, design, and marketing teams. He currently handles 20-30 different tasks and 8-10 meetings per week using physical notebooks, post-it notes, and company emails. This fragmented system has led to missed deadlines, double-booked meetings, and significant time wasted searching for information.

By creating a centralized and secure platform accessible from both his Windows 11 office computer and company-issued iPhone, we aim to streamline Mr. K's workflow. The application will be developed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) using Python with the Django framework for the backend. This choice addresses Mr. K's concerns about data security and provides robust authentication mechanisms to protect confidential project information.

The proposed solution will enhance efficiency by reducing administrative overhead, preventing scheduling conflicts, and providing quick access to critical project data. It will enable Mr. K to quickly add tasks during meetings, set reminders, and synchronize information across devices in real-time.
